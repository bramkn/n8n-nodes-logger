# n8n-nodes-logger

This is an n8n community node. It lets you execute a logger workflow which you can configure however you want.
After the logger is done, it will automatically continue the flow without altering the incomming data.


[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
